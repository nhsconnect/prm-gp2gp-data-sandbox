    "# TPP Attachment Limit investigation - Oct 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- TPP have increased the attachment limit and this has reduced the number of errors related to large attachments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "- TPP had a 60mb GP2GP attachment limit that should have been increased to 100mb over the last few months. We wanted to see if that change has reduced the number of errors related to large messages. \n",
    "- To note, we are unable to access the MI Data past Feb 2020, but we are able to access the SPINE logs. Therefore the following is based on data analysis from the SPINE logs. But there were also issues with the SPINE logs since migration to Spine Cloud, which are noted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- YGA is TPP\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- This notebook requires febuary spine logs to be stored as \"feb.csv.gz\" in the data folder"
