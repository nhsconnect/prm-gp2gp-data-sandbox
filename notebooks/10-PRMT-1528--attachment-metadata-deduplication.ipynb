    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we suspect that there is duplication in the attachments dataset. We believe attachments are being logged multiple times:\n",
    "- once in the `EHR request completed` message\n",
    "- again in a COPC message when large messaging is used (due to overal size of EHR and attachments exceeding 5mb or 99 attachments limit)\n",
    "- again in multiple COPC messages when attachment is broken down into fragments (due to being over 5mb)\n",
    "- again if there are duplicated `EHR request completed` messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplication caused by COPC messages could be resolved by filtering them out such that for each transfer we only consider attachments referenced in the manifest contained in the `EHR request completed` message. We propose enriching attachments dataset with interaction ID to enable this filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplication caused by multiple `EHR request completed` messages could be rosolved by counting attachments only from the latest one.\n",

    "### Requirements\n",

    "In order to replicate this notebook, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into Splunk and run the following query, for 21/12/2020 00:00:00:00 to 03/01/2020 24:00:00 time frame. Export the result as a csv named `attachment_metadata.csv`. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the following Splunk query for the same time range. Export the result as a csv named `gp2gp_messages.csv`.\n",

    "| table _time, conversationID, internalID, interactionID\n",

    "3. Place both the csv files in a directory called `attachments`. Set the `INPUT_DATA_DIR` environment variable to point to this directory.\n",
